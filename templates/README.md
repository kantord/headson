# Legacy templates

This directory contains older Askama-based templates that are not used by the
current renderer. The active implementation renders directly from Rust using the
style modules in `src/serialization/templates/` (`json.rs`, `pseudo.rs`, `js.rs`).

The files here are retained for historical reference and may be removed in a
future cleanup once no longer needed.
